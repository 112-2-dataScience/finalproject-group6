# [Group5] 電子商務交易詐欺預測
With the rapid advancement of electronic payments, the incidence of e-commerce fraud has escalated, leading to substantial financial losses for businesses and creating a negative experience for customers. Fraudsters employ various tactics, such as using stolen credit cards, taking over accounts, and engaging in friendly fraud. These activities result in financial chargebacks, disrupt operations, and damage the reputation of businesses. This growing issue poses a significant threat not only to individuals but also to financial institutions and the overall market stability.

Given the increasing prevalence and complexity of e-commerce fraud, our objective is to develop an advanced detection system. This project aims to build a fraudulent transaction detection system utilizing machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, transaction details, and historical patterns, we strive to identify suspicious activities with high accuracy, thereby mitigating the impact of fraud.
